# FiCoRI

The First Colombian Radio Interferometer (FiCoRI) is a two-element solar radio interferometer, developed and designed in Colombia. The instrument is located at Observatorio Astronómico Nacional de Colombia, in the Bogotá campus of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. It operates in a broad frequency bandwidth, up to 800 MHz continiously 24 hours every day. FiCoRI is the product of a joint effort of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional (OAN), the Space Sciences Laboratory (SSL) and the University of California Berkeley.

This GITHUB repository includes the main codes necessary to operate the interferometer. These codes are based on the work previously developed by the Collaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research (CASPER) of the Radio Astronomy Lab in UC Berkeley, check out its webpage https://casper.berkeley.edu

Hardware and software by CASPER have been adapted to performace the desired features for FiCoRI. FiCoRI is a project still in development with future plans that may include addittional antennas, modification of hardware setup, and re-location of the instrument.
